# Power Bank Warning

Wires have been soldered to the + and – terminals of the power bank PCB (Solar Manager C). As a result, the manufacturer’s warranty is void, and I do not assume any responsibility in the event of issues, fire, or other incidents.
However, during the testing phase everything worked without any problems, and the functionality of the power bank did not appear to be affected.
